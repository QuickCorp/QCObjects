**Changes:** 
Please put here a piece of code you want to simplify or improve. You’re free to fork QCObjects for your own needs but I highly recommend you to spend some time standardizing. We review everything and test everything almost everywhere we can before to put in action a code change. And it’s because we want to make QCObjects a really professional tool, not just another “JavaScript something”. We want your projects to be listed in the best quality line lists. So please let us reject some proposals in order to make this happen.
